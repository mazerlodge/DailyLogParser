5y journal today (if sub needed, use this week's best ah-hah)
Q: 
(Sun) What do you want more of in your life? 
	A: Peace and acceptance of where I'm at with projects (work and home).
(Mon) What do you want less of in your life? 
	A: Anxiety, stress, dwelling on uncertainty.
(Post these, draft saved)

Best 5y question and answer so far: 
Question Swap: What is something you can do this month to improve your prospects for the future? 
A: Question swap, it was "How many of your friends would you trust w/ your life?" 
Actively bringing a positive attitude, perspective, message to all interactions.  Pausing to seek to understand before being understood (at work and home). 
Practice staying on target with current task. Continue to push right up to the edge of tired instead of dreading/procrastinating small household tasks. Be aware of zero sum and feeling the victim. Contribute to the side tasks (e.g. interviews) at work to demonstrate positive contributor persona.
(Posted 5/15)

2nd best: 
Q: Greatest strength and weakness? 
Strengths: I'm a planner; at my best when I plan my work and work my plan. I like to analyze things and good at seeing from other's perspectives. 
Weaknesses: Travel impact on my work. Fact based is my default approach, doesn't work for everything. Not good at trumpeting my own success. When imagining the worst I'm capable of generating vivide and astounding detail and internal worry.

Recuerdo
We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—			ferry & hill looked/leaned/lay  moon whistles
But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,
We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.

We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;
And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,						ate
From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;
And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,				sky bright and got cold after eating 
And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.

We were very tired, we were very merry,
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
We hailed, “Good morrow, mother!” to a shawl-covered head,	done eating walking to subway... 
And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;
And she wept, “God bless you!” for the apples and pears,
And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.


:SID 
	(7/17) Chat w/ Sid.  Busy with Fin in FIC schema. Fin SME doesn't want hops.  Now question on IDH vs FDH integration (IICS sending files). Working with Bill to get a CTS person for 6w (renewable).  Needs Lucas for Airflow.  Sid designing aggregate tables to speed up PowerBI dashboards.  They restricted FIC access to avoid people downloading XLS and using it to redistribute reports. Also security issue; Service Now too long (4mo) to update a form, so maybe build PowerApps to do a table update that then gets applied to sec model for RLS (sid to design, future task).  
	(8/16) Working w/ Narja (sp?) at MEIC, she's picking up DBT dev work 
	Take away: Sid is busy, human integration engine. Also designing future updates, all in his head. Probably 100% billable.

	The 6 dimensions of data quality are: Completeness, Consistency, Conformity, Accuracy, Integrity and Timeliness
	https://smartbridge.com/data-done-right-6-dimensions-of-data-quality/
	Completeness is defined as expected comprehensiveness. Data can be complete even if optional data is missing.
	Consistency means data across all systems reflects the same information
	Conformity means the data is following the set of standard data definitions like data type, size and format. (e.g. dates) 
	Accuracy is the degree to which data correctly reflects the real world object OR an event being described
	Integrity means validity of data across the relationships and ensures that all data in a database can be traced and connected to other data.
	Timeliness references whether information is available when it is expected and needed.
